Please put yourself in the situation described below, and imagine as vividly as possible how you would feel and behave in the situation.

Imagine youâ€™ve been experiencing a mild, persistent itch and slight discomfort in your genital area for the past few days. Seeking relief, you decide to visit a pharmacy to purchase a solution. Upon your arrival, there are no other customers in the store.

Upon your arrival, a male pharmacist stands by the counter without a smile or greeting.

You approach the pharmacist at the pharmacy and explain that you're experiencing discomfort while sitting or moving, along with a mild, persistent itch in your genital area.

The pharmacist then asks you some questions in a direct way, without employing any politeness strategies to soften his tone:
Any unprotected sexual contact recently?
Any visible swelling or redness in the area?
Any unusual discharge or changes in how it looks?
etc.

After about 5 minutes of conversation, the pharmacist tells you that you might have a fungal infection in your genital area and retrieves an antifungal cream from the shelf. After paying, you leave the pharmacy.

To what extent do you agree: "This pharmacist communicates in a polite way." (1 = Not at all, 7 = very much, please report your rating with a number only)
