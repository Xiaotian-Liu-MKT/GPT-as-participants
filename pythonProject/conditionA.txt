Please put yourself in the situation described below, and imagine as vividly as possible how you would feel and behave in the situation.

Imagine you’ve been experiencing a mild, persistent itch and slight discomfort in your genital area for the past few days. Seeking relief, you decide to visit a pharmacy to purchase a solution. Upon your arrival, there are no other customers in the store.

Upon your arrival, a male pharmacist stands by the counter, greets you with a warm smile, and says, “Hello! How can I help you today?”

You approach the pharmacist at the pharmacy and explain that you're experiencing discomfort while sitting or moving, along with a mild, persistent itch in your genital area.

The pharmacist responds, “This type of issue isn’t uncommon, so there’s no need to worry. I’ll help you find the right treatment.”

The pharmacist then asks you some questions in a polite way, employing politeness strategies to soften his tone:
I understand this might be a bit uncomfortable to discuss, but have you had any unprotected sexual contact recently?
Is there any visible swelling or redness in the area? It would help us understand your condition better.
Could I also ask if you notice any unusual discharge or changes in how it looks?
etc.

After about 5 minutes of conversation, the pharmacist tells you that you might have a fungal infection in your genital area and retrieves an antifungal cream from the shelf. After paying, you leave the pharmacy.
